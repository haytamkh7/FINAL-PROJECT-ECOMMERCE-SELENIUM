# FINAL PROJECT ECOMMERCE SELENIUM - BEYOND DEV, Amdocs
BEYOND DEV is a QA Automation Development bootcamp by Amdocs, during which we are asked to present a final project at the end of the bootcamp.
This is **the first part** of the project, in which we are automating functional features of amazon.com website.
For instance:
- Registering process
- Logging in with invalid email address
- Signing-up with incorrect values in the signing-up form fields
etc...
